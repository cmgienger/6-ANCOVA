## Molerat Example {.smaller}

Mole rats are the only known mammals with distinct social castes.
A single queen and a small number of males are the only reproducing individuals in a colony.
Remaining individuals, called workers, gather food, defend the colony, care for the young, and maintain the burrows.
<br> <br> "Frequent workers" do almost all of the work in the colony, whereas "infrequent workers" do little work except on rare occasions after rains, when they extend the burrow system.
To assess the physiological differences between the two types of workers, Scantlebury et al. (2006) compared daily energy expenditures of wild mole rats during a dry season.
Energy expenditure appears to vary with body mass in both groups, but infrequent workers are heavier than frequent workers.

## Molerats

![](images/molerat.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="750"}

How different is mean daily energy expenditure between the two groups when adjusted for differences in body mass?

## Molerats: Read in the data

```{r}
#molerat <- read.csv(url("http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~schluter/WhitlockSchluter/wp-content/data/chapter18/chap18e4MoleRatLayabouts.csv"))
molerat <- read.csv("molerat.csv")
str(molerat)
```

</br> Note that these are log transformed data.

## Molerats: Visualize the Data

```{r}
ggplot(molerat, aes(x = lnMass, y = lnEnergy, colour = caste)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE)+ 
  #this method allows regression lines to be heterogeneous
  theme_bw(15)
```

Lines don't look very parallel.
Need to test.
</br> First we fit a model allowing separate slopes.

## Molerats: Fit Separate Slopes Model {.smaller}

```{r}
model1<-lm(lnEnergy~lnMass*caste, data=molerat)
summary(model1)
```

</br> The interaction is not significant (P = 0.32); therefore we have evidence that it is not important and should be removed.

## Molerats: Fit Same Slopes Model {.smaller}

```{r}
model2<-lm(lnEnergy~lnMass+caste, data=molerat)
summary(model2)
```

As mass increases, energy use increases.
</br> After accounting for variation in body mass, there is a significant effect of caste.

## Compare Models {.smaller}

Lets check whether we are justified in removing N.S.
interaction term.

```{r}
anova(model1, model2)
```

-   There is no significant difference between the models, so the simpler explanation should be supported.

-   Including the N.S.
    interaction term did not lead to a better explanation.

-   Notice that the P value of 0.32 for the model comparison is the same as the interaction term P value in model1.

## Generate Predictions to use in Same-Slopes Graph

`Model 2` had parallel slopes (no interaction).

```{r}
predictions_model2 <- predict(model2) 
#calculate regression lines ('predictions') from model2 by using
#every value of X (lnMass) to get the predicted value of Y (lnEnergy)
predictions_model2
```

'Predictions' for a same slopes model.

## Use Predictions in Same Slopes Figure

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
ggplot(molerat, aes(x = lnMass, y = lnEnergy, color = caste) ) +
     geom_point() +
     geom_line(aes(y = predictions_model2)) +
  theme_bw(15)
```

These lines are definitely parallel and our model supports this rather than the separate slopes model.

## ANOVA Table - Same Slopes {.smaller}

ANOVA and Summary tables to help with reporting results.

```{r}
summary(model2)
```

</br> Common slope (both castes) between lnMass and lnEnergy = 0.89.

Worker caste had ln0.39 more lnEnergy use than lazy caste.

## Molerat Results Statement {.smaller}

"We tested the hypothesis that energy expenditure of molerats differed among castes after accounting for differences in body mass between the groups. We found a positive relationship between mass and energy expenditure (slope = 0.89, t = 4.6, P \< 0.001), and after accounting for body mass, there was a difference between worker and lazy castes (t = 2.69, P = 0.01)."

</br> </br> The difference in energy expenditure between lazy rats and worker rats was ln(0.393) \[look at summary(model2) output\].
If we are going to report this, we need to back transform (not done here for clarity).

## Practice with `msleep` Data from ggplot {.smaller}

Is there a difference between carnivores (Carnivora) and rodents (Rodentia) in duration of REM sleep after accounting for variation in total amount of sleep?

```{r}
msleep <- msleep %>% 
  dplyr::select(name, order, sleep_total, sleep_rem)
head(msleep, 15)
```

</br> </br> There are some NAs we need to take care of.

## Import Data {.smaller}

```{r data 1}
d1 <- msleep %>%
  filter(order == "Carnivora" | order == "Rodentia") %>%
  filter(!is.na(sleep_total)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(sleep_rem))

d1$order <- factor(d1$order)
```

## Make ancovaplot (separate slopes) {.smaller}

```{r ancovaplot}
library(HH)
ancovaplot(sleep_rem ~ sleep_total * order, data = d1)
```
## Make ggplot (separate slopes) {.smaller}

```{r plot 1}
p1 <- 
  ggplot(d1, aes(sleep_total, sleep_rem, color=order))+
  geom_point(size=5) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=FALSE) + ##sep. slopes is the default
  theme_bw()
p1
```
## msleep: Fit Separate Slopes Model {.smaller}

```{r model 1}
m1 <- lm(sleep_rem~sleep_total * order, data=d1)
anova(m1)
```
</br>

No significant interaction, so no evidence that lines should be allowed to cross. Remove the 
interaction term -> refit model -> replot the figure

## msleep: Fit Same Slopes Model {.smaller}

```{r}
m2 <- lm(sleep_rem~sleep_total + order, data=d1)
anova(m2)
```

<br>
<br>

Make 'predictions' (the regression lines) for a same-slopes fit.
```{r predictions for same slopes model}
predictions_m2 <- predict(m2) #forces lines to be parallel
```

## Compare Models {.smaller}

Lets check whether we are justified in removing N.S.
interaction term.

```{r}
anova(m1, m2)
```

## msleep: Replot the data for a same-slopes model fit. {.smaller}

```{r plot 2}
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
p2 <- 
  ggplot(d1, aes(sleep_total, sleep_rem, color=order))+
  geom_point(size=5) +
  geom_line(aes(y = predictions_m2)) +
  theme_bw()
p2
```
